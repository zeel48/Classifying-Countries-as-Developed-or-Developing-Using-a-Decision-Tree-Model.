# Classifying-Countries-as-Developed-or-Developing-Using-a-Decision-Tree-Model.
The project "Classifying Countries as Developed or Developing Using a Decision Tree Model" leverages socio-economic indicators to categorize countries as developed or developing. Using data such as GDP, population density, agricultural land, life expectancy, and unemployment rate, the model is trained to predict a country's development status. A decision tree classifier is used due to its ability to handle both numerical and categorical data, allowing the model to capture complex patterns. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, achieving an accuracy of 84.44%. Visualizations like decision tree plots and distribution counts enhance the analysis
